What's New in SDO Java 1.1-incubating

Apache Tuscany's SDO Java Release 1.1-incubating is the second such release
with full coverage of the SDO 2.1 specification (First being 1.0-incubating).

It includes some new features and improvements along with a number of bug fixes (see below for detail).

For previous revision history, take a look at
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/tuscany/tags/java/sdo/1.0-incubating/sdo/distribution/RELEASE_NOTES.txt

SDO Java 1.1-incubating is a superset of previous SDO 1.0-incubating release.
Anything in 1.0-incubating is also in 1.1-incubating, but 1.1-incubating contains
features and bugfixes not present in 1.0-incubating release.

Binary Artifact Changes
=======================

PLEASE NOTE that
Since the 1.0-incubating-beta release the following binary artifacts have been renamed

The maven groupId of the SDO API binary artifact has changed from "commonj" to "org.apache.tuscany.sdo"

The maven artifactId for the SDO API binary artifact has changed from "sdo-api-r2.1" to "tuscany-sdo-api-r2.1"

The jar file containing the SDO API has a new "tuscany-" prefix,  so what was ..
sdo-api-r2.1-1.0-incubating-beta1.jar in the beta1 release becomes
tuscany-sdo-api-r2.1-1.0-incubating.jar in this release.

In addition a new maven artifact and jar has appeared.

maven groupId=org.apache.tuscany.sdo
maven artifactId=tuscany-sdo-lib
jar archive=tuscany-sdo-lib-1.1-incubating

This artifact provides a clear distinction between Tuscany SDO implementation,  and the Tuscany
API which extends the SDO API.  See the javadoc contained in the binary release for details of
the function provided by this artifact.
