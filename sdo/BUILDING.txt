Building the SDO Java Implementation Project from the source distribution 
=========================================================================

Building
--------
1) Download the corresponding SDO specification source distribution from http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany
2) Execute the instructions in that archive for building the SDO specification component
3) Change to the top level directory of the Tuscany SDO Java Implementation project (sdo) of this source distribution.
4) Execute: mvn
   This will first place build artefacts in your local maven repository that your SDO programs can depend upon. It
   will then build the Tuscany binary distribution artefacts in the sdo/distribution/target directory.

Note: Depending on the load being experienced by remote Maven 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several
    times until required dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a
    full successful build you can use "mvn -o" which is much faster.
