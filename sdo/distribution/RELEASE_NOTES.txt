What's New in SDO Java Beta1

Details are described below.

SDO Java Beta1 is a superset of previous SDO Java M2 release.
Anything in M2 is also in Beta1, but Beta1 contains features and bugfixes not present in M2 release.
SDOJava Beta1 is an implementation of the SDO 2.1 specification.There are 3 SDO 2.1 features which
do not have an implementation in this release,  those being
  XMLHelper load/save with Source/Result (TUSCANY-1214)
  DataHelper.convert (TUSCANY-1213)
  Property.isNullable() and Property.isOpenContent()(TUSCANY-1212)

Compatibility Concerns
  Beta1 now uses the SDO 2.1 interfaces whereas M2 used the 2.0.1 interfaces.
  A program written to the M2 dynamic SDO API/SPI can compile against Beta1 libraries,
  although some API and SPI interfaces have been deprecated between releases.
  In most instances these programs will execute as before, but if the programs relied
  on the exposure of EMF Property instances through the SDO API then they will fail.
  Static SDO classes generated with the M2 release must be regenerated before they will work in an Beta1 environment.
  A program written for Beta1 cannot necessarily compile or run against M2 libraries.
