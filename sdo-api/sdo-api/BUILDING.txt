Building the SDO Java Specification Project from the source distribution 
=========================================================================
(note,  these instructions are for building the SDO binary release from
source, not for establishing a development environment.  If you wish to
participate in sdo development, follow the instructions at 
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TUSCANY/Developing+SDO+Java)

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE JDK 1.4.2 or above
2) Install Maven:
Download Maven 2.0.4 (download from http://maven.apache.org/download.html).



Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of the Tuscany SDO Java Spec project (<archive-root>/sdo-api) of this source distribution.
2) Execute: mvn
This will build an artefact in your local maven repository that the SDO implementation can use. 

Note: Depending on the load being experienced by remote Maven 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several times
    until required dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a full successful
    build you can use "mvn -o" which is much faster.
