Tuscany SDO Java M2 Sample Program Distribution
===============================================

This is a distribution of the sample programs for the Tuscany SDO Java implementation.

Building the SDO Java Samples Project from this source distribution 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: If you have already built the SDO for Java Implementation source distribution
then these sample programs are included in that distribution and are built as part
of that process.  This distribution archive is provided for building against a
binary distribution of SDO for Java. 

Ensure that all the jar files found in the SDO for Java binary distribution's
lib directory are on your java classpath, and use your java 1.4.2 (or greater) compiler to
compile the classes in this distribution in your own favourite development environment.

Look at the site/apidocs/index.html to understand how to run these programs.
