Building the SDO Java Samples Project from the source distribution 
=========================================================================

There are two ways of building the SDO Samples source distribution.

1) You can overlay this distribution on the SDO Java Implementation source distribution
by extracting this archive in the top level "sdo" folder of the SDO Implementation source
code distribution.  After having followed the instructions for building the SDO
implementation from the source distribution  change directory to the toop level folder
of this archive and run the command "mvn".

Or 2) You can ensure that all the jar files found in the SDO for Java binary distribution's
lib directory are on your java classpath, and use your java 1.4.2 (or greater) compiler to
compile the classes in this distribution in your own favourite development environment.
