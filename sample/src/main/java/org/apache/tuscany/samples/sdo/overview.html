	<title>SDO Sample Overview</title>
</head>
<BODY>
<h1>Tuscany Service Data Object (SDO) Sample Programs</h1>  
<h2>Overview</h2>
This sample code is from the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany"
 target="_blank"> Apache Tuscany</a> project. The samples were written to help users
understand and experiment with SDO.  You can get a feel for the topics that are
covered by each sample by looking at the <a href="sampleProgramContents.html">
documentation</a> that is produced by the DocumentSamples utility.
<H2>Experimentation</H2>
The SDO samples are written to be used in conjunction with the specification and other documents.  However, 
the most important function that these samples provide is a place to begin experimenting with the SDO API
and programming model.  Developers are encouraged to extend and experiment with the current set of samples.  
If a sample is unclear, is missing documentation or a tutorial, or does not cover a desired area ,
please send feedback to the tuscany mailing lists,
or better still send us a patch or join the Tuscany team and contribute back to the
<A href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany">project</A>.
  

<h3>Getting Ready to run the Samples</h3>
The samples depend on the following libraries<UL>
		<LI>The SDO API and the Tuscany SDO Implementation
		<UL>
			<LI>sdo-api-{version}.jar - SDO API</LI>
			<LI>tuscany-sdo-lib-{version}.jar - Tuscany APIs and support function</LI>
			<LI>tuscany-sdo-impl-{version}.jar - Tuscany SDO implementation</LI>
		</UL>
		</LI>
		<LI>EMF dependencies.
		<UL>
			<LI>common-{version}.jar - some common framework utility and base
			classes</LI>
			<LI>ecore-{version}.jar - the EMF core runtime implementation
			classes (the Ecore metamodel)</LI>
			<LI>ecore-change-{version}.jar - the EMF change recorder and
			framework</LI>
			<LI>ecore-xmi-{version}.jar - EMF's default XML (and XMI)
			serializer and loader</LI>
			<LI>xsd-{version}.jar - the XML Schema model</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>If you are running these samples from a Tuscany samples distribution you can resolve these dependencies by ensuring that all the jar files in the lib directory of the extracted distribution are on your classpath.<BR>
<BR>
If you are running these samples as a result of building Tuscany SDO for Java from a Tuscany source distribution using maven then these dependencies will be resolved by having followed the build instructions.<BR>
<BR>To run these samples against the current Tuscany codebase, follow the instructions at <A
	href="http://cwiki.apache.org/TUSCANY/developing-sdo-java.html">Developing SDO Java</A>, which describes how to build Tuscany SDO for Java in an Eclipse SDK environment.</P>
<H3>Running the Samples</H3>
<P>In order to get an overview of the samples the user may wish to run
{@link org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.ExecuteSamples} which will execute
all the command line examples.<BR>
<FONT face="Courier">java org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.ExecuteSamples</FONT></P><P>Alternatively, browse the JavaDoc for the sample program classes and run an
individual example of your choice in the same way. Another suggestion is to read the
SDO specifciaton in conjunction with the examples in {@link
org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.specExampleSection}.</P></BODY></html>
