What's New in SDO Java ${sdo.version}

Apache Tuscany's SDO Java Release ${sdo.version} is the first such release
with full coverage of the SDO 2.1 specification.

In addition to adding the few remaining SDO 2.1 features not included in the
${sdo.previousversion} release and fixing a number of bugs (see below for detail)
there are a number of new features relating to XML serialization, and new
support for handling dynamic derivation from static classes.

For previous revision history, take a look at
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/tuscany/tags/java/sdo/${sdo.previousversion}/sdo/distribution/RELEASE_NOTES.txt

SDO Java ${sdo.version} is a superset of previous SDO ${sdo.previousversion} release.
Anything in ${sdo.previousversion} is also in ${sdo.version}, but ${sdo.version} contains
features and bugfixes not present in ${sdo.previousversion} release.
