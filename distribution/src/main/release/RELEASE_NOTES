Service Data Objects (SDO) Java version ${sdo.version} Release Notes

The Service Data Objects (SDO) API simplifies and unifies Service Oriented Architecture
(SOA) data access and code.

SDO offers both a static and a dynamic programming model for data access.
Choosing to generate static classes to repreent your data model gives you
the ease and intuitive nature of the static programming model,  backed up
by the power of the dynamic model too.

SDO also offers the capacity to track changes to data. If a graph of data
includes a change summary property, then additions, modifications, and deletions
made to the graph within the scope of that change summary will be recorded.
  
What's new in this Release
==========================

Apache Tuscany's SDO Java Release ${sdo.version} is the first such release
with full coverage of the SDO 2.1 specification.

In addition to adding the few remaining SDO 2.1 features not included in the
${sdo.previousversion} release and fixing a number of bugs (see below for detail)
there are a number of new features relating to XML serialization, and new
support for handling dynamic derivation from static classes.  There has also
been significant focus on making the SDO sample programs more accessible.

For previous revision history, take a look at
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/tuscany/tags/java/sdo/${sdo.previousversion}/sdo/distribution/RELEASE_NOTES.txt

SDO Java ${sdo.version} is a superset of previous SDO ${sdo.previousversion} release.
Anything in ${sdo.previousversion} is also in ${sdo.version}, but ${sdo.version} contains
features and bugfixes not present in ${sdo.previousversion} release.

Binary Artifact Changes
=======================

PLEASE NOTE that
Since the 1.0-incubating-beta release the following binary artifacts have been renamed

The maven groupId of the SDO API binary artifact has changed from "commonj" to "org.apache.tuscany.sdo"

The maven artifactId for the SDO API binary artifact has changed from "sdo-api-r2.1" to "tuscany-sdo-api-r2.1"

The jar file containing the SDO API has a new "tuscany-" prefix,  so what was ..
sdo-api-r2.1-1.0-incubating-beta1.jar in the beta1 release becomes
tuscany-sdo-api-r2.1-1.0-incubating.jar in this release.

In addition a new maven artifact and jar has appeared.

maven groupId=org.apache.tuscany.sdo
maven artifactId=tuscany-sdo-lib
jar archive=tuscany-sdo-lib-${sdo.version}

This artifact provides a cleear distinction between Tuscany SDO implementation,  and the Tuscany
API which extends the SDO API.  See the javadoc contained in the binary release for details of
the function provded by this artifact.
