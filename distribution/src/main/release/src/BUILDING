Building the SDO Release from a Source Distribution
===================================================


Note,  these instructions are for building the SDO binary release from
source, not for establishing a development environment.  If you wish to
participate in sdo development, follow the instructions at 
http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/developing-sdo-java.html


Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE JDK 1.4.2 or above
2) Install Maven:
Download Maven 2.0.4 (download from http://maven.apache.org/download.html)


Building
--------



Note: following this step you will have maven installed, and a Java JDK at level 1.4.2 or above installed.
3) If you have chosen to install a JDK at level 5 then all will be fine,  but there is one value add component in the
   Tuscany SDO implementation which relies on new JDK 5.0 features.  If you do not wish to use JDK 5 for the following
   build step, then you will need to delete the file
   <archive-root>/sdo/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/tuscany/sdo/generate/Interface2JavaGenerator.java before proceding
4) Change to the top level directory of the Tuscany SDO Java Implementation project (<archive-root>/sdo) of this source distribution.
6) Execute: mvn
   This will install the sdo implementation and tools jars in your local maven repository
cd to distribution and run mvn

Note: Depending on the load being experienced by remote Maven 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several
    times until required dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a
    full successful build you can use "mvn -o" which builds without trying to access updated build dependencies (offline mode) and is much faster.


7) To run the sample programs, change directory to the <archive-root>/sdo/sample directory, and run the command "mvn".  Then look in the <archive-root>/sdo/sample/target/site/apidocs/index.html file for javadoc that describes how to run the samples.
