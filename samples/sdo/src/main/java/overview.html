<h2>Overview</h2>
Tuscany, Service DataObject samples.  
The following packages are from the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany"
 target="_blank"> Apache Tuscany</a> project. They were written to help users
understand and experiement with SDO. Some are based upon example code contained
within, and is meant for use with, and reference to the <a
 href="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/specs/ws-sdo/SDO_Specification_Java_V2.01.pdf"
 target="_bank">SDO Specification</a>, others are based upon papers, and some were simply written 
	specifically for these samples.

<H3>Experimentation</H3>
The SDO samples are written to be used in conjunction with the specification and other documents.  However, 
the most important function that these samples provide is a place to begin experimenting with the SDO API
and programming model.  Developers are encouraged to extend and experiment with the current set of samples.  
If a sample is unclear, is missing documentation or a tutorial, or does not cover a desired area people
are encouraged to join the Tuscany team and contribute back to the project.
  

<h3>Where to start</h3>
In order to get an overview of the samples the user may wish to run {@link org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.ExecuteSamples} which will 
	execute all the command line examples.  Another suggestion is to read the SDO specifciaton in conjunction with the examples in 
	{@link org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.specExampleSection}    
   
<h3>Usage</h3>

These samples can be easily be run from within Eclipse as a Java Application if tuscany
or the sample-sdo project is imported into Eclipse as an existing project.  For more information 
on setting up a Tuscany environment please refer to the following Guide : 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/ws/Tuscany/TuscanyJava/GetTuscany" target="_bank">Check out and build Tuscany</a>


<br><br>      
Most of the samples can also be executed as a standalone application.  In general you simply need to :

  <UL>
  <LI>Include the following jar files on your classpath :
  <UL>
  <LI>SDO API and Tuscany Implementation
  <UL>
  <LI>sdo-api-{version}.jar - SDO API
  <LI>tuscany-sdo-impl-{version}.jar - Tuscany SDO implementation
  </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>EMF dependencies. 
  <UL>
  <LI>emf-common-{version}.jar - some common framework utility and base classes
  <LI>emf-ecore-{version}.jar - the EMF core runtime implementation classes (the Ecore metamodel)
  <LI>emf-ecore-change-{version}.jar - the EMF change recorder and framework
  <LI>emf-ecore-xmi-{version}.jar - EMF's default XML (and XMI) serializer and loader
  <LI>xsd-{version}.jar - the XML Schema model
  </UL>
  </LI>
  </UL>
  
  These jar files can be obtained from directly from Tuscany and EMF projects or from <a
  href="http://wiki.apache.org/ws-data/attachments/Tuscany(2f)TuscanyJava(2f)SDO_Java_Overview/attachments/SDO%20Execution%20Dependencies"
  target="_bank">SDO Execution Dependancies </a> </LI>
  <LI>Include sample, and sample resources (i.e required xml files) on the classpath. You can simply place the SDO sample jar (i.e sample-sdo.jar), 
    or place any SDO sample/test code on your classpath </LI>
  <LI>Execute: java desiredSample 
        <br><i>i.e java org.apache.tuscany.samples.sdo.ExecuteSamples</i> 
  </UL>
