Building the SDO Java Implementation Project from the source distribution 
=========================================================================
(note,  these instructions are for building the SDO binary release from
source, not for establishing a development environment.  If you wish to
participate in sdo development, follow the instructions at 
http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/java_sdo_overview.html

Building
--------
1) Download the corresponding SDO specification source distribution from http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany
2) Execute the instructions in that archive for building the SDO specification component
Note: following this step you will have maven installed, and a Java JDK at level 1.4.2 or above installed.
3) If you have chosen to install a JDK at level 5 then all will be fine,  but there is one value add component in the
   Tuscany SDO implementation which relies on new JDK 5.0 features.  If you do not wish to use JDK 5 for the following
   build step, then you will need to delete the file
   sdo/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/tuscany/sdo/generate/Interface2JavaGenerator.java before proceding
4) Change to the top level directory of the Tuscany SDO Java Implementation project (sdo) of this source distribution.
5) Execute: mvn
   This will first place build artefacts in your local maven repository that your SDO programs can depend upon. It
   will then build the Tuscany binary distribution artefacts in the sdo/distribution/target directory.

Note: Depending on the load being experienced by remote Maven 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several
    times until required dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a
    full successful build you can use "mvn -o" which is much faster.
