Note,  these instructions are for building the SDO binary release from
source, not for establishing a development environment.  If you wish to
participate in sdo development please visit the Apache Tuscany web site
as detailed in the accompanying README file.


Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE JDK 1.4.2 or above
2) Install Maven: Download Maven 2.0.9 (download from http://maven.apache.org/download.html) Follow the maven instructions for
configuring the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and ensuring that the "mvn" command is on your execution PATH.

Building
--------

1) Open a command window/shell and change to the top level directory of the Tuscany SDO Java source distribution.
3) If using JDK 5, execute: mvn
   If using JDK 1.4.* execute mvn -Pjava_1_4_maven
   This will install the sdo implementation and tools jars in your local maven repository
4) If you wish to rebuild the Tuscany SDO Java binary distribution change directory to "distribution" and run mvn
   This will create archives of the binary and source distributions in the target subdirectory of the distribution directory

Note: Depending on the load being experienced by remote Maven 2.0 repositories you may have to execute mvn several
    times until required dependencies are all located in your local maven repository.  After you have completed a
    full successful build you can use "mvn -o" which builds without trying to access updated build dependencies (offline mode) and is much faster.

    Also note that there can be intermittent problems downloading the EMF dependencies from the Maven repositories, using the command "mvn -U" 
    should resolve this and you may need to run the command several times to get all the EMF dependencies successfully downloaded.
